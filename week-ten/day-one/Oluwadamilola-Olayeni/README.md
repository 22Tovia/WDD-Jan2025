Today i learnt about the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions. 

Synchronous functions are functions that allows another functiion to operate when it is done operating. While asynchronous functions are the ones which can be paused while continuing another functon.

for synchronous it runs a program at a time. asynchronous starts now and continue later. 

fetch() helps use the javascript to load data from APIs, it takes time to fetch data from your network.once you fetch a data  it gives a promise. 
which is divided into 3 
1. pending phase
2. fulfilled 
3. rejected.

awaits help us to stop and wait for asynchronous operation to finish.



while also going through the Youtube videos i learnt about HTTP request used to get Datbase APIs 
learnt on how to get data using GET,port,post and send.
